# OCR Application Test Project

## Overview
The Test Project provides comprehensive unit and integration tests for the OCR Application Core, ensuring reliability, accuracy, and performance of the OCR processing capabilities.

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- **Image Preprocessing Tests** (`ImagePreprocessingTests.cs`): Validate image processing algorithms
- **Text Similarity Tests** (`TextSimilarityTests.cs`): Verify text comparison algorithms
- **OCR Extraction Tools Tests** (`OcrExtractionToolsTests.cs`): Test core extraction functionality
- **Ensemble OCR Tests** (`EnsembleOcrTests.cs`): Validate multi-engine processing

### Integration Tests
- **Integration Tests** (`IntegrationTests.cs`): End-to-end testing of the OCR pipeline

### Test Utilities
- **Test Helpers** (`TestHelpers.cs`): Shared testing utilities
- **Mocks**: Mock implementations for testing isolated components

## Test Frameworks and Dependencies
- MSTest for test execution and assertions
- Moq for mocking dependencies
- Emgu.CV for image processing validation
- System.Drawing.Common for image handling
- EPPlus for Excel output validation

## Configuration
Tests use a dedicated `ocr_config.json` file that's configured specifically for the testing environment.

## Running Tests
Tests can be run using:
- Visual Studio Test Explorer
- Command line: `dotnet test TestProject.csproj`
- CI/CD pipeline integration

## Test Organization
Tests are organized following the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern:
1. **Arrange**: Set up test data and expected results
2. **Act**: Execute the functionality being tested
3. **Assert**: Verify the results against expectations

## Continuous Integration
The tests are designed to be run as part of a CI/CD pipeline, ensuring code quality with each commit.

## Coverage
The test suite aims to achieve high code coverage across all critical components of the OCR application:
- Image preprocessing algorithms
- Text extraction and recognition
- Text comparison and similarity
- Export functionality
- Error handling and edge cases

## Adding New Tests
When extending the OCR functionality, corresponding tests should be added:
1. Create a new test method within the appropriate test class
2. Follow the AAA pattern
3. Use appropriate assertions
4. Ensure test isolation (tests should not depend on each other)

## Testing Best Practices
- Tests should be independent and idempotent
- Use appropriate mocking for external dependencies
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain test data separately from test logic
